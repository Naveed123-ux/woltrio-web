description: "Woltrio API Security delivers continuous protection for APIs through deep defense and intelligent analysis. By detecting business logic attacks and OWASP API Top 10 threats, it leverages smart analytics to conduct in-depth traffic analysis, providing timely alerts, risk confirmation, and proactive security recommendations."

list: 
    - label: "Identify API Risks"
      value: "
      <p>Continuously discover and monitor all API assets, including shadow APIs, zombie APIs, malicious APIs, and sensitive APIs. Each API is assigned a detailed risk profile to reveal vulnerabilities and misuse risks.</p>
      "

    - label: "Confirm API Risks"
      value: "
      <p>Through big data intelligence, runtime data such as sensitive data streams, call maps, usage patterns, and user activity are analyzed to validate API behavior risks and threat activity levels.</p>
      "

    - label: "Predict API Risks"
      value: "
      <p>Utilize AI/ML-driven analysis with 10 built-in risk scenarios to predict potential security threats early, enabling proactive defense instead of passive detection.</p>
      "

    - label: "Identify Vulnerable APIs"
      value: "
      <p>Detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in APIs targeted by attackers, covering the OWASP API Top 10 risks. Ensure only authorized users access APIs while preventing improper access and insider threats.</p>
      "

    - label: "Prevent API Misuse & Fraud"
      value: "
      <p>Real-time monitoring blocks malicious activities such as SQL injection, XSS, and malware injection. AI-powered detection prevents both known and unknown API attacks.</p>
      "

    - label: "Prevent Sensitive Data Leakage"
      value: "
      <p>Identify sensitive APIs lacking authentication or zero-trust strategies. Prioritize stronger security controls to protect critical data from leaks or misuse.</p>
      "

    - label: "Key Benefits"
      value: "
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Protect Data Security:</strong> Prevent malicious API attacks and data breaches, safeguarding customer information and business continuity.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to Deploy & Manage:</strong> User-friendly interface with out-of-the-box templates for cloud, on-premises, and hybrid deployment.</li>
